# Research Orchestration

Domain-specific orchestration recipes for research and knowledge synthesis.

## Codebase Exploration

**Pattern**: Fan-Out + Reduce

### Phases
1. **Parallel Discovery** (Fan-Out)
   - Spawn explore agent: File structure and organization
   - Spawn explore agent: Key patterns and conventions
   - Spawn explore agent: Dependencies and integrations
   - Spawn explore agent: Test structure and coverage

2. **Synthesis** (Reduce)
   - Spawn architect to combine findings
   - Produce comprehensive codebase map

## External Research

**Pattern**: Fan-Out + Reduce

### Phases
1. **Parallel Research** (Fan-Out)
   - Spawn researcher agents for different aspects
   - Each uses WebSearch and WebFetch for external sources
   - Gather documentation, best practices, comparisons

2. **Evaluation** (Pipeline)
   - Spawn architect to evaluate findings
   - Produce recommendation with pros/cons

## Competitive Analysis

**Pattern**: Map-Reduce

### Phases
1. **Map** - Spawn researchers to analyze each competitor/alternative
2. **Reduce** - Spawn architect to synthesize comparative analysis
3. **Recommend** - Produce decision matrix with trade-offs

## Knowledge Synthesis

**Pattern**: Pipeline

### Phases
1. **Gather** - Fan-out explore and researcher agents to collect information
2. **Organize** - Architect structures knowledge hierarchically
3. **Document** - Writer produces accessible documentation
4. **Review** - Critic validates completeness and accuracy
